## Project Requirements Overview

This project satisfies the following requirements:

1. *Data Analysis and Exploration*  
   - Preprocessing for missing values, outliers, etc.  
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.  
   - Feature selection for optimal performance.

2. *Clustering*  
   - Implementation of [insert algorithm(s), e.g., "k-Means"] to identify patterns in data.  
   - Evaluation metrics: [Insert metrics used, e.g., "Silhouette Score"].

3. *Baseline Training and Evaluation*  
   - Implementation of Decision Trees and other baseline models like Naive Bayes.
   - Evaluation using [insert metrics, e.g., "Accuracy, RMSE"].

4. *Neural Networks*  
   - Application of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).  
   - Fine-tuning and comparison with baseline models.
